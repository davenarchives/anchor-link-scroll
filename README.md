# Anchor Link Scroll

This guide explains how to implement smooth scrolling when an anchor link is clicked, allowing the page to automatically scroll to a specific element on the same page.

## Overview

When using anchor tags (`<a>`) with `href` attributes pointing to an ID of an element on the same page, the browser will automatically scroll to that element. By adding a smooth scroll effect, the user experience is improved, making the transition between sections visually appealing.
